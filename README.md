# Dictionary

It is "Dictionary" Application built using Java Swing. It was built to get used to the practical implementation of Data Structures concept like Binary Search Tree in real world application. 
This project has two main modules.
* Inbuilt Dictionary -: In this Dictionary we have already added the words and their meanings which is stored in words.txt file. You can directly go to the search in Dictionary option and search the words and their meanings.
* Create Own Dictionary -: In this Dictionary we need to first add our own words and their meanings and then we can search them.

## Working of the Project

There are two ways we can run the project.
* Dictionary.jar.
* CMD :- We need to run the GUI.java file.

Now coming on the working of individual Files.There are three java files and one text file in the master branch.

### GUI.java
As the name suggests it contains the methods to create the basic GUI of the project. In this i have created the two modules of the project one is search in dictionary and create own dictionary as i explain earlier.

### FileReader.java
It is used for reading the words and meanings from the words.txt and store it in the Dictionary object so that we can use them as needed.'

### Dictionary.java
It is the most important file as far as code logic is concerned. This file has the main logic for adding the word and searching the word in Binary Search Tree.

### Words.txt
In words.txt we have stored the already define words and their meanings for the inbuilt dictionary.
